        <h2>What is an XSS Attack?</h2>
        <p class = "maintext">
            Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
            are a type of injection, where
            malicious scripts are injected
            into trusted websites. These
            attacks occur when an attacker
            uses a web application
            to send malicious code, generally
            in the form of a browser-side
            script, to a different end user.
            Attackers often initiate an XSS
            attack by sending a malicious link
            to a user and enticing the user
            to click it.

        <h2>How are users impacted by XSS attacks</h2>
        <p class = "maintext">
            The variety of attacks based
            on XSS is almost limitless,
            but they commonly include
            transmitting private data,
            like cookies or other session
            information, to the attacker,
            redirecting the victim to web
            content controlled by the attacker,
            or performing other malicious
            operations on the userâ€™s machine
            under the guise of the vulnerable site.

        <h2 class="search-form-header">How do you test for XSS vunerabilities?</h2>
        <p class="maintext">
            You can confirm most kinds of XSS vulnerability
            by injecting some sort of harmless script.
            It is common to test for XSS vunerabilities by using the alert()
            function for this because it's short,
            harmless, and pretty hard to miss when it's
            successfully called.
        </p>
        <p class = "maintext">
            This is an example of a vunerable
            input field. In this input field a
            malicious attacker could inject code.

            <h2>Code Examples of different XSS attacks</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Reflected XSS attack</h3>
            <p class = "maintext">
                Reflected XSS attacks are where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
                Try inserting this code at the end of the URL of this website.
            </p>
            <img class="diagram" src = "../assets/url.png"/>
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>&lt;img src onerror="alert('This is a reflected XSS attack')" /&gt;</code>
            <button class = "copyTextButton" onclick="copyText1()"><img class = "clipbored" src = "../assets/clipboard.png" alt = "clipboard"></button>
            <br>

            <h3>Stored XSS attack</h3>
            <p class = "maintext">
                A stored XSS attack occurs when a web
                application fails to properly sanitise
                user-supplied input before storing it
                in a database or server-side resource
                (e.g., a message board, comment system
                , or user profile). When this unsanitised
                data is later retrieved and rendered on
                a web page, it can allow an attacker's
                malicious script to execute in
                the context of a legitimate user's
                browser session. Try this simple stored XSS attack,
                the page will reload, but you should see the
                HTML code below the vulnerable search bar.
            </p>
            <code>&lt;h1 style="color:red;font-size:50px;"&gt;This is a stored XSS attack!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            <button class = "copyTextButton" onclick="copyText()"><img class = "clipbored" src = "../assets/clipboard.png" alt = "clipboard"></button>
            <br>
            <form class="search-form" autocomplete="off">

                <input class="search-input" id="query-input" type="text" name="query" />
                <br>
                <br>
                <button class="search-button" type="submit" role="button">Search</button>
            </form>
            <p class="search-query">You Queried: <span id="query-output" class="query"></span></p>


            <h3>DOM-based XSS attack</h3>
            <p class="maintext">
                DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as eval() or innerHTML. This enables attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, which typically allows them to hijack other users' accounts. (rewrite)

    <section class="hidden">
        <h2>How to prevent XSS attacks</h2>
        <p class="maintext">XSS attacks can be mostly be prevented through encoding and validating user input</p>

        <h3>Encoding user input</h3>
        <p class="maintext">
            Encoding should be implemented just
            before inserting user-controlled data
            onto a page since the encoding method
            depends on the context of the insertion.
            For instance, values within a
            JavaScript string needs a
            different form of encoding compared
            to data in an HTML context.
        </p>

        <p class="maintext">
            For example in an HTML
            context this is how you
            would encode non whitelisted
            values
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code class="example1"><</code><p class="example1">&nbsp;turns into &nbsp;</p><code class="example1">&amp;lt;</code></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><code class="example1">></code><p class="example1">&nbsp;turns into &nbsp;</p><code class="example1">&amp;gt;</code></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            In a JavaScript string context, non-alphanumeric values should be Unicode-escaped:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li ><code class="example1">></code><p class="example1">&nbsp;turns into &nbsp;</p><code class="example1">\u003e</code></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><code class="example1"><</code><p class="example1">&nbsp;turns into &nbsp;</p><code class="example1">\u003c</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="maintext">
            Sometimes you'll need to
            apply multiple layers of
            encoding, in the correct
            order. For example, to
            safely embed user input
            inside an event handler,
            you need to deal with
            both the JavaScript context
            and the HTML context.
            So you need to first
            Unicode-escape the
            input, and then
            HTML-encode it:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="x='This string needs two layers of escaping'"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;</code>

        <h3>Validating user input</h3>

        <p class="maintext">
            Encoding is probably the most important line
            of XSS defense, but it is not sufficient to
            prevent XSS vulnerabilities in every context.
            You should also validate input as strictly
            as possible at the point when it is first
            received from a user.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try this code from earlier,
            the only difference is that
            this search bar is using sanitisation
            to prevent malicious code injections.
        </p>
        <code>&lt;img src onerror="alert('This is a reflected XSS attack')" /&gt;</code>
        <button class = "copyTextButton" onclick="copyText1()"><img class = "clipbored" src = "../assets/clipboard.png" alt = "clipboard"></button>



        <form class="search-form" autocomplete="off">
            <input class="search-input" id="query-input1" type="text" name="query1" />
            <br>
            <br>
            <button class="search-button" type="submit" role="button">Search</button>
        </form>
        <p class="search-query1">You Queried: <span id="query-output1" class="query1"></span></p>

        <h3>Content Security Policy </h3>

        <p>
            Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer
            of security that helps to detect and mitigate
            certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site
            Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
            These attacks are used for everything from
            data theft, to site defacement, to malware
            distribution.
        </p>

        <p>
            Configuring Content Security Policy involves
            adding the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header
            to a web page and giving it values to control
            what resources the user agent is allowed to
            load for that page.
        </p>

        <h4>Specifying your policy</h4>
        <p>You can use the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to specify your policy, like this:</p>
        <code>Content-Security-Policy: policy</code>

        <h2>What technologies do XSS attacks affect</h2>
        <p class = "maintext">
            Cross-Site Scripting only affects websites,
            however XSS attacks can also affect other
